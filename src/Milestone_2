# Milestone 2 report
## Rationale
Our rationale for the set-up of this app is to allow users to view the data with location and question responses being the main object of interest.
In order to view subsets of the large amount of survey responses when you click on a country, the user is able to see plots below the map based on the country they select.
They can also click on the dropdown list of countries to see multiple countries and view summary statistics for the selected countries in the plot tab. As seen in the screenshots above as the bar graph plots. 
Originally we wanted these bar charts of survey responses, age, and gender to show up by hovering over the map, but this took up too much space, and covered the map, so by having it below the map, it is less overwhelming and easier to understand.


## Tasks
The following are the tasks which were completed for Milestone 2:
•	Build a standard ‘filter’ side panel used for each of the ‘Map’, ‘Plot’ and ‘Data Explorer’ tabs.
•	Build ‘Map’ tab 
    o	Create a map 
    o	Create plots based on selected country marker on the map by the user.
•	Build ‘Plot’ tab 
    o	Create plots based on user selected filters from the ‘filter’ panel.
•	Build ‘Data Explorer’ tab
    o	Raw data based on selected filters from the ‘filter’ panel.
• Further exploration of features with the team will help confirm which features are most relevant and informative towards the proposal.

## Vision & Next Steps
My goal for the next milestone is to create a prettier bar plots, clean up the data, and add a comparison plot with grouped bar charts.
We will also double check all of the geotags are correct.
If time permits, I will implement this for the next milestone.

Bugs
There are several bugs in my app that will need to be fixed for the next iteration. For example,
