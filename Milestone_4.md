# Milestone 4  

## Exercise 1: Writeup

Briefly discuss:  
•	What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?  
  
Given the time limit, we decided to focus on implementing 3 changes to our shiny app:  
   1.	Adding a tab that allows a user to further explore and visualize data for each question by state for the United States. 
   2.	Add an ‘about’ link for users to read detailed information about the project on GitHub.
   3.	Corrected spelling errors in the app.  
      
We decided on limiting changes to these 3 points because we felt they would enhance value to the app for further data and project         exploration, as well as overall usability for users. These changes also required the least amount of work to implement with our given time constraint. In particular, changes 1 and 2 required reusing existing code in the app to incorporate these new functionalities and change 3 required only basic editing.

•	If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?  

If we were making this app again from scratch, we would:  
  
   1.	Spend more time to explore different or more map implementations and functionalities to overcome shortcomings such as:
        a.	Pie chart labels for each country were difficult to implement. The ‘pop up’ map feature was manipulated to provide this       functionality as a temporary fix.  
        b.	A fix for preventing a pie/bar chart’s ‘spacing’ potentially overlapping another pie/bar chart based on the size of the data being visualized. 
   2.	Spend more time on data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDS) to better explore and clean data to the find the ‘optimal’ features for the project.
