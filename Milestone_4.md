# Milestone 4  

## Exercise 1: Writeup

rubric={reasoning:25}

Briefly discuss:

- What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on? 
- If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?
- What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

Here, we'll be grading your reasoning for the changes. Don't worry about "optimizing" your decision, we're just looking for sensibility here.

## Exercise 2: Implementation

rubric={quality:10, accuracy:10, reasoning:40}

Implement the changes that you've decided to make. We'll be grading:

- The quality and accuracy of the code associated with your changes.
- The effectiveness of the change with respect to your app's objective.
