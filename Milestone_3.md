# Milestone 3
Reflect on the usability of your app. How easy or hard was it for your peers to use your app? 
- It was relatively easy for users to use our map, although they were not sure about how the map visualization really added to the data exploration since clicking only changed the output of the plots.
Did you expect them to use the app in they way they did?
- we did not expect them to get confused by the differences between the two plots on the map tab vs. the analysis tab.

What things did you hear that's similar across reviewers? Is there a theme here?
- We heard that the bar chart on the map page is redundant and slightly confusing. 
- There are too many dropdown items to choose from.

From the feedback, what things do you think are appropriate to change in your app, particularly given the time frame you have to improve the app?
What is unreasonable to change, and why? 
- The feedback was very feasible for us to implement. We changed the map tab to have more visual info (pie charts) and moved all of the bar plots to the analysis tab called 'compare countries'.
- We reduced the number of dropdown items
- We cleaned the data more so that the values and outputs made more sense
- we took out the histograms as they were hard to read
- we took this feedback into account: change "Columns" into something more meaningful and changed it to "survey questions" and "country"
In the future we plan to improve the app in the following ways:
- add the download button for the data table
- add more info on why the survey was done and how to use the app, perhaps with a landing page
- figure out how to make the countries more visible (whole highlight) rather than choosing a random point on the map.
- perhaps add city gps data for the US.

What feedback was the most/least valuable?
- Most valuable feedback= what info is the map conveying/adding to your analysis? ie The map marker could be used to show some useful information instead of just marking the place. 
- Least valuable feedback= "There can be an option for displaying all the data in the data explorer tab". We did this, so this was note bery helpful feedback.

What part of the feedback process was most/least valuable?
- most valuable:
What did you learn from your experience being a "fly-on-the-wall". Was this useful? Why or why not?
- Yes this was fun becuase it allowed us to see how a new user might interact with our app. This very quickly pointed out flaws in our design which we were then able to fix. I would like to use this process for feedback in the future.

Did the feedback process lead to an improved app? What parts were valuable? What parts were not valuable?
- YES it definitely did! All parts were valuable. Building apps are a very iterative process, so the more feedback the better.
